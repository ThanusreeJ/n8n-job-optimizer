# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - 4 Day Progress Demo

## For Your 12 PM Sync Call

### What to Show:

1. **Project Structure** (Day 1)
   - Show the organized folder structure
   - Mention data models created
   - Show .env.template (API connection setup)

2. **Baseline Scheduler** (Day 2)
   - Run the app: `streamlit run ui/app.py`
   - Click "Generate Sample Data"
   - Click "Day 2: Run Baseline (FIFO)"
   - Show the simple First-In-First-Out scheduling results

3. **Batching Agent** (Day 3)
   - Click "Day 3: Run Batching Agent"
   - Explain: *"This uses AI to group similar product types together, reducing setup times"*
   - Show the reduced setup switches metric

4. **Bottleneck Agent** (Day 4)
   - Click "Day 4: Run Bottleneck Agent"
   - Explain: *"This balances the workload across machines to prevent bottlenecks"*
   - Show the improved load imbalance metric

### Key Talking Points:

✅ **Day 1:** "I set up the project structure and verified the Groq AI API connection works"

✅ **Day 2:** "I built a functional baseline scheduler and web interface where we can upload jobs and see schedules"

✅ **Day 3:** "I developed the AI logic that intelligently groups similar jobs to minimize setup changes"

✅ **Day 4:** "I implemented workload balancing to ensure no single machine gets overloaded"

### What's Coming Next (Day 5+):
- Constraint validation (shift limits, downtime windows)
- Supervisor agent to orchestrate everything
- Advanced comparison dashboard
- Full integration

### Demo Flow (2-3 minutes):

1. Open app
2. Generate sample data
3. Run Day 2 → Show baseline results
4. Run Day 3 → Show batching improvement
5. Run Day 4 → Show final balanced schedule

**Time needed:** Less than 5 minutes to demonstrate!
